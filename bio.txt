BIO

Bives breaks out onto the music scene with an electrifyingly new indie pop-rock sound. Based in Los Angeles, they seamlessly move between exhilarating energy and heartfelt intimacy, always infused with an irresistible and danceable groove. Drawing comparisons to Glass Animals, The Neighborhood, Arctic Monkeys, and Gorillaz; Bives is bringing original and exciting vibes to 2025.
Tomás, Elias, and Miles all moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 2019 where they met in their dorm building’s communal kitchen. Miles and Elias attended the same high school, but had never met prior to becoming roommates. In 2021, Tomás and Elias moved in together which led to them co-writing and recording demos of multiple songs which would later constitute the band’s EP. Liam had met Elias during high school in 2015 through the Bay Area music scene, and joined the band after moving in with Elias in early 2023.
